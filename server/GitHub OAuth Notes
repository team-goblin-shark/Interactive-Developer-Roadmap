How can we go about implementing OAuth?
We need to create a route for GitHub OAuth server to obtain authorization
Create button element to emulate click for OAuth

Create a middleware controller for OAuth
We will need to send a post request to the access token url
    It will need to include the authorization code and the client secret and client include

What are we doing today?
    Figure out if express-session middleware automatically creates a cookie for us
